# Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Netflix Dataset

### Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the **Netflix Movies and TV Shows** dataset. The goal is to uncover patterns, identify outliers, and understand the relationships between different content features as part of the AI & ML Internship at Elevate Labs.

### EDA Process & Visualizations
Following the task guidelines, I implemented the following:
1. [cite_start]**Numerical Distribution:** Plotted histograms for `release_year` to track content growth over time[cite: 11].
2. [cite_start]**Categorical Analysis:** Used count plots to compare the volume of Movies vs. TV Shows[cite: 12].
3. [cite_start]**Outlier Detection:** Utilized box plots on `duration` to identify unusual movie lengths[cite: 13].
4. [cite_start]**Correlation Analysis:** Generated a heatmap to visualize the relationship between release year and duration[cite: 14].

### Visual Insights
* [cite_start]**Content Growth:** A massive spike in content additions occurred after 2015, indicating Netflix's shift toward original productions[cite: 15, 17].
* [cite_start]**Content Type:** Movies dominate the library, making up a much larger portion of the catalog than TV Shows[cite: 15].
* [cite_start]**Outliers:** While the average movie is ~100 minutes, several outliers exist with durations exceeding 200 minutes or falling below 40 minutes[cite: 15, 17].
* [cite_start]**Correlation:** There is no significant correlation between the year a movie was released and its total duration[cite: 15].
